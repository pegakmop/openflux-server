# OpenFlux Control Plane

**English** | [Русский](README.ru.md)

Full HTTP API reference: [API.md](API.md) ([Русский](API.ru.md)).

Multi-tenant key/token management, traffic accounting, and node coordination for OpenFlux exit
nodes. This is a separate Go module and a separately deployed service — it does not carry or
relay any tunneled traffic itself; that still flows directly between client and exit node over
the transport (Yandex Docs, etc.), exactly as before. The control plane only handles control
traffic: issuing/validating keys, batched traffic-usage reports, and node coordination.

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable                          | Required | Description                                                        |
|------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CONTROLPLANE_DATABASE_URL`        | yes      | Postgres connection string (`postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db`)   |
| `CONTROLPLANE_TOKEN_PEPPER`        | yes      | Secret appended before hashing every token; rotating it invalidates all existing tokens |
| `CONTROLPLANE_ADMIN_TOKEN`         | yes      | Bootstrap bearer token for the `/v1/admin/*` endpoints              |
| `CONTROLPLANE_LISTEN_ADDR`         | no       | Default `:8080`                                                     |
| `CONTROLPLANE_RATE_LIMIT_RPS`      | no       | Per-IP requests/sec allowed on `/v1/resolve`, default `1`           |
| `CONTROLPLANE_PUBLIC_URL`          | no       | How clients reach this server (e.g. `https://your-domain-or-ip`, no path/trailing slash) — set by `deploy/install.sh` automatically. Without it, key-creation responses omit `deep_link` (see API.md) since a link with no working `control_url` isn't useful |

Migrations in `internal/db/migrations` run automatically on startup (tracked in a
`schema_migrations` table, safe to run repeatedly).

## Build & run

```bash
go build -o controlplane ./cmd/controlplane
CONTROLPLANE_DATABASE_URL="postgres://openflux:secret@localhost:5432/openflux?sslmode=disable" \
CONTROLPLANE_TOKEN_PEPPER="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
CONTROLPLANE_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
./controlplane
```

## Admin panel

Two interchangeable frontends are served — pick one, or both:

- **Embedded fallback (Go, always works):** a self-contained HTML page
  (`internal/api/web/admin.html`, no build step, no external assets) is embedded into the
  binary and served at `/admin/`, in Russian. Paste `CONTROLPLANE_ADMIN_TOKEN` once (kept in the
  browser's `localStorage`), then a "Keys" tab covers create/list/filter/enable/disable/delete,
  and a "Settings" tab covers the registered exit node (status, heartbeat, rotate its token) plus
  ingest-token management.
- **Full dashboard (SvelteKit + Bun, recommended):** `controlplane/web` — SvelteKit 5, Tailwind,
  SSR + client hydration, RU/EN, dark/light theme, QR deep links on key creation, a dashboard with
  stat cards and a traffic chart, server load card, node/key/ingest management. Ships with a
  production entry (`bun server.js`, `controlplane/web/README.md`) that also proxies `/v1/*` to
  this Go process for http-mode deployments without Nginx; in the normal Nginx setup use the split
  described below so Go never goes through Bun.

Nginx (recommended): `/v1/*` → this Go service on `:8080`, `/admin/*` → Bun on `:3000`. Deploy
fragments: `controlplane/web/deploy/` (systemd unit, Nginx location, env template).

## Concepts

- **Node** — one exit-node process/machine. Has its own bearer token, polls for the keys assigned
  to it, and reports usage.
- **Key** — one end-user's access token. Bound to a `transport` + `doc_url` (e.g. a specific
  Yandex Docs link), has an optional `traffic_limit_bytes`, and can be enabled/disabled. Created
  either directly by an admin or in bulk via an ingest token.
- **Ingest token** — a scoped credential handed to a third-party app/script that generates keys
  (and their backing Yandex Docs) and registers them here.

New keys are best-effort auto-assigned to whichever active node currently has spare capacity
(`max_keys`), so you scale by registering more nodes, not by growing one process.

## Cascades (two-hop exit)

A key normally exits straight from its assigned node. It can instead exit through a *second*
node instead: client → Yandex Docs (disguised) → entry node → fast encrypted UDP link → final-exit
node → real internet. Only the client-facing hop needs to look like something else - the two nodes
are both yours, so the link between them is plain (if still encrypted) UDP instead of paying Yandex's
disguise overhead a second time. Typical use: an entry node inside a heavily-filtered network,
final-exiting through a node elsewhere.

To set one up:
1. Register both nodes normally (same flow either way - nothing marks a node as "entry" or
   "final-exit" ahead of time, that's decided per key below).
2. On the **Nodes** page, set the final-exit node's **public address** (its own IP or hostname, no
   port) - a node only ever calls out to this controlplane, so there's no other way to learn it.
3. On the **Keys** page, open a key's cascade control and pick that node as its final exit. This
   allocates a dedicated UDP port for the link (a small 41000-41999 range, separate from raw mode's
   own per-key port allocation) and both nodes pick it up on their next poll.

Not supported yet: combining a cascade with `e2e_encryption` on the same key (the final-exit node
would need to own the E2E unwrap instead of the entry node, and that boundary isn't wired up) - the
entry node refuses to start that key rather than getting it wrong. Usage accounting is unaffected
either way: it's still measured on the entry node's client-facing side, so nothing double-counts.

## API walkthrough

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:8080
ADMIN=$CONTROLPLANE_ADMIN_TOKEN

# 1. Register an exit node, get its token
NODE=$(curl -s -X POST $BASE/v1/admin/nodes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"node-eu-1","max_keys":300}')
echo "$NODE"
NODE_TOKEN=$(echo "$NODE" | jq -r .token)
NODE_ID=$(echo "$NODE" | jq -r .id)

# 2. Create an ingest token for a third-party key-generation script
INGEST=$(curl -s -X POST $BASE/v1/admin/ingest-tokens \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"label":"key-gen-bot"}')
INGEST_TOKEN=$(echo "$INGEST" | jq -r .token)

# 3. That third-party app registers a new key (its own Yandex Docs link)
curl -s -X POST $BASE/v1/ingest/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"label":"user-42","doc_url":"https://docs.yandex.ru/docs/edit?url=...","traffic_limit_bytes":10737418240}'

# 3b. List or revoke ingest tokens later (e.g. one leaked)
curl -s $BASE/v1/admin/ingest-tokens -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN"
curl -s -X POST $BASE/v1/admin/ingest-tokens/<id>/disable -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN"

# 4. The exit node polls for its assigned keys
curl -s $BASE/v1/nodes/keys -H "Authorization: Bearer $NODE_TOKEN"

# 5. The exit node reports batched usage
curl -s -X POST $BASE/v1/nodes/$NODE_ID/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NODE_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"deltas":[{"key_id":"<key-id>","bytes_sent_delta":1048576,"bytes_received_delta":2097152}]}'

# 6. A client resolves its own key to connection details
curl -s -X POST $BASE/v1/resolve -H "Authorization: Bearer <client key token>"
```

## Scaling notes

- The service is stateless besides Postgres, so run multiple replicas behind a load balancer.
- `/v1/resolve` is the only endpoint an untrusted client token hits directly; it's rate-limited
  per IP (in-memory token bucket — resets per replica, so treat it as a brake on casual abuse, not
  a hard guarantee).
- Usage is reported in batches by each node on an interval, not per packet, so write volume scales
  with node count, not user count. A single batch is capped at 1000 deltas server-side
  (`handleNodeUsage`) — the node itself chunks into multiple requests above that, so this only
  matters if you're changing the cap on both ends together.
- How many keys one exit node can serve depends on its `--mode` (see the main README): `proxy` has
  no per-node cap beyond what the box's own resources allow; `raw` reserves a disjoint port range
  per key to avoid cross-talk on the one shared raw socket/IP, which caps a single raw-mode node at
  roughly 252 concurrent keys (`portRangeSize`/`portRangeMax` in `nodeagent/orchestrator.go`) —
  assign more nodes rather than expecting one raw-mode node to grow past that.
- A raw-mode node's raw sockets are opened once per process and shared by every worker on it, not
  one pair per key - see `tunnel/rawsocket_linux.go`'s `rawSocketCore` - so CPU spent on the return
  path scales with real traffic, not with how many keys happen to be assigned to that node.
